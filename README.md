# Customer-Acquisition-through-Digital-Advertising
# Big Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing customer acquisition through digital advertising and non-compliance in randomized experiments. 
This project focuses on analyzing and evaluating customer acquisition strategies through digital advertising and exploring non-compliance issues in randomized experiments. It includes:
Customer Acquisition Analysis: Examines the impact of digital advertising on customer behavior, including income and purchase patterns, using statistical tests.
Non-Compliance Analysis: Investigates the effects of vitamin A supplementation on mortality rates, considering compliance and treatment impact.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains dataset files (`GameFun.xlsx` and `sommer_deger.csv`).
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data analysis.
  - `exercise1.py`: Analyzes customer acquisition data.
  - `exercise2.py`: Analyzes non-compliance in randomized experiments.
  - `utils.py`: Contains helper functions for data analysis.

## Requirements

- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- openpyxl (for reading Excel files)

Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Place your data files in the `data/` directory.
